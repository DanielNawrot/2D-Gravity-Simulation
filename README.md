# 2D Gravity Simulation

In this project I challenged myself with programming a large body gravity simulation. Although simple and unrefined, I learned many things through this project. 

The simulation uses Newton's Gravity Equations: 

![\Large x=\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?F_{g}=\frac{GM_{1}M_{2}}{r^{2}})
